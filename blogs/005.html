      while scrolling through youtube, i came across this video on my feed by
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9">javidx9</a> -

      about building a sound synthesizer in c++, so i thought of giving audio
      programming a shot. in this blog post, we'll cover few of the basic topics
      and build a simple program which would generate a sine wave of a certain
      frequency and save it to a <code>.wave</code> file, amplify and peform
      stereopanning on a given <code>.wave</code> file.

    <h2>what is sound?</h2>

    <p>
      sound is a phenomenon caused by vibration in particles that propagates as
      a wave through a transmission medium such as air, water, or solids. most
      of the sounds in the real world propagate in the form of a sine wave (or
      combination of different sine waves).
    </p>

    <p>
      for example, the note A above middle C on the piano propagates as a
      (almost) pure sine wave with a frequency of 440Hz (<a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/10tffnh/how_can_a_piano_key_have_only_one_frequency/"
        >ref: how can a piano key only have one frequency?</a
      >) and it can be mathematically represented as follows:
    </p>

    <blockquote>y = sin(880&pi;x)</blockquote>

    <h2>what is audio?</h2>

    <p>
      sound is a mechanical wave energy, while audio is the electrical
      representation of that sound wave.
    </p>

    <p>
      a microphone converts the mechanical sound waves into analog signals which
      is later passed through an analog-digital converter (ADC) which converts
      these analog signals into digital signals, which would be understood by a
      computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      there are two important keywords in the context of digital audio -
      <b>bit rate</b> and <b>sample frequency</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      the analog signals hold information about various wave characteristics at
      that particular instant such as the amplitude. sample frequency is the
      number of times a
      <i>snapshot</i> of these characteristics is taken and these snapshots are
      later used to re-create the sound wave.
    </p>

    <p>
      most of the audio which is delivered nowadays either uses 44.1 kHz or 48
      kHz as the sample frequency. the frequency limit of humans range from 20
      Hz to 22 kHz. nyquist rate is the minimum sampling rate needed to
      accurately represent a signal and it is twice the highest frequency of the
      signal.
    </p>

    <blockquote>44100 = 2 * 22000 + 100</blockquote>

    <p>
      why isn't it 44 kHz? well, an additional 100 Hz sorta acts like a
      transition band or room for error, which prevents unwanted distortion in
      the higher frequencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      in the early days, digital audio was stored on modified video recorders
      and 44.1 kHz worked perfectly with the video equipment at that time and it
      became the industry standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      bit depth is related to the precision of each <i>snapshot</i>. if the bit
      depth is 16 then the maximum number which could be represented is +32767
      (((2^16 - 1) - 1)/2) and the least is -32767. a snapshot could either have
      +ve or -ve amplitude. so in simple words - the higher the bit depth, the
      more clearly it is represented digitally, at the regions with really high
      or really low frequencies.
