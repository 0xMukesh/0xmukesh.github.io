I'm Mukesh -- a backend engineer with a knack for diving deep into systems and figuring out how things work under the hood. On the side, I'm passionate about machine learning, specifically vision, where I enjoy exploring how models see and interpret the world.

I'm 18. Currently, I'm working on [cleopetra](https://docs.cleopetra.fun), where we're simplifying the process of liquidity pooling on Solana's decentralized exchanges. Apart from that, I'm also an undergraduate student at [NIT Warangal](https://nitw.ac.in), pursuing my bachelor's degree in biotechnology.

Besides the technical stuff -- I'm a self proclaimed full-time shutter button enthuiast, basically I like photography. I love watching movies, especially crime thrillers or japanese country side movies (something like [swing girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435434/), [linda linda linda](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468795/). I really love the [final scene from "swing girls"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDhLJeU455w)).

I also maintain a technical blog, check it out - [blog](./blogs/)
